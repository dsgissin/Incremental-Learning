# Incremental-Learning

This repository holds the scripts that can be used to recreate the experiments detailed in the paper "The Implicit Bias of Depth: How Incremental Learning Drives Generalization". The scripts are self-contained and should be relatively self explanatory - each one requires arguments such as the learning rate, dimensionality of the data, initialization scale and so on.
